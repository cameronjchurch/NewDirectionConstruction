                    WHAT IS A BAY OR BOW WINDOW?
                    Bay and bow windows are combinations of windows joined together to create a curve that extends beyond the walls of your home. 
                    Bay windows consist of three windows – two angled, operable windows with one central fixed panel – while bow windows are typically four or more windows.
